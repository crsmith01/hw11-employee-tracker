## User Story

```
As a business owner,
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
```


## Acceptance Criteria
***UPDATE THIS***

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```
*Note: I tried making it work with organization like the solved file for the Hot Restaurant mini-project, but I kept having issues with getting the paths and passing correct. I'll go back and try that another time. For now, all routes are on server.js.

## Mock-Up

The following images and video demonstrate the command-line application's appearance and functionality: 

![Existing notes are listed in the left-hand column with empty fields on the right-hand side for the new note’s title and text.](./Assets/11-express-homework-demo-01.png)

![Note titled “Workout” reads, “BodyStep112 and Core 41 (45-minute format) before 2pm”, with other notes listed on the left.](./Assets/11-express-homework-demo-02.png)
